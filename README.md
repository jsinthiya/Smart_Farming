# Smart Farming: Automated Cultivation and Breeding Systems

## Overview
This project is designed to enhance farming productivity using IoT and automation. The system focuses on automating key agricultural tasks such as seed planting, fish feeding, and egg incubation. The system uses real-time monitoring and control through Firebase, ensuring a more efficient farming process.

## Features
- **Automated Seed Planting System**: Utilizes servo motors and DC motors to plant seeds accurately in a controlled environment.
- **Greenhouse Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse with automatic climate control features.
- **Incubator with Egg Turner**: Automated egg-turning system to maintain optimal conditions for hatching.
- **Automated Fish Feeder**: Ensures fish are fed at regular intervals, controlled remotely via Firebase.
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time monitoring and control of farming operations using NodeMCU and Firebase.
